### Hi, I'm Boon Juan ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm Boon Juan and I'm dealing with network devices as a career. Currently, my interest lie in front-end development and my focus right now is building a solid understanding of React and the tools it offers. In order to accomplish this, I'm taking an online course on full-stack development while building my own applications in parallel.

On my own time, I like to play games such as MOBA and simulator genres (Kairosoft games).

### You can call me Gingkoi too, I used them for most of games and other stuff too! :)
